2 types of sign in - one for teachers and one for students.

## Design
The design of the website is aimed to be interesting and easy to use for younger students. It is fully responsive so the
users can log in and study regardless where they are. The main UX rules are kept such as readable text, clear signs to fins
and locate things on the page.

The logo has been designed by me, using CorelDraw.
